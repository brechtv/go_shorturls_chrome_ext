# Short URL demo

This is a demo Chrome extension that allows you to set arbitrary short URLs and redirect them to their full URL equivalent. For demonstration purposes I've used the `go/foo` format, since that's what Google came up with, but you can use any prefix or format.

For example, I can set `go/home` to redirect to `https://goo.gl/maps/UYV4osh7p192`, so each time I type `go/home` in my Chrome address bar, it redirects me to my directions home. No server needed.

## How to use

Download or clone this repository and load it as an unpacked extension in your Chrome browser.
